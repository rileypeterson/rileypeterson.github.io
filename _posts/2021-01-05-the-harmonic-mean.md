Today I re-visited what the harmonic mean is. I thought this was an [interesting example (from Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean#Average_speed):

>In many situations involving rates and ratios, the harmonic mean provides the correct average. For instance, if a vehicle travels a certain distance d outbound at a speed x (e.g. 60 km/h) and returns the same distance at a speed y (e.g. 20 km/h), then its average speed is the harmonic mean of x and y (30 km/h) â€“ not the arithmetic mean (40 km/h).
