## Useful commands
`bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`

## Install
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/

## Notes
* One thing I really want for my site is a sidebar. Everyone online is really quickly to make some fancy plugin. Guess I'll be going the long way to figure this one out. 
* I like the default minima theme but I wanted to make a few changes to it and just see what it actually looks like so I just copied that into my root folder: 
    ```
    cp -r /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/minima-2.5.1/* ./
    ```
* This had the effect of overwriting the README, unfortunately
