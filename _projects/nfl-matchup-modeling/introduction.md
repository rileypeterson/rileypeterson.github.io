The NFL consists of 16 regular season games. Each week teams battle it out on the field while oddsmakers in Vegas
are determined to set lines that will be bet equally on both sides. Traditionally, the three most common betting
lines are:

-  Moneyline - The team that will win the game.
-  Spread - The differential between the favored team's score and the underdog.
-  Over/Under - The total number of points in the game.

As an example, here are the current lines for an upcoming game this weekend (Week 10):

The goal of this project is to use mathematical methods and analysis to correctly predict the winning side, the spread, and total points.
