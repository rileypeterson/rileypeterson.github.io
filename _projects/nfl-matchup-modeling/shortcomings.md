If you know anything about the upcoming matchup I've been running with you would think that's crazy. Here are some reasons why:

*  First and foremost:
    > The Weather Channel is calling for an 80 percent chance of rain in Cleveland on Sunday, with 25-35 mph winds and occasional gusts over 50 mph.

    Clearly this model does not account for inclement weather.
*  Large standard deviations. If the distribution of points is "too wide", then it has trouble predicting a blowout more one sided result.
*  No recency bias. The Colts have come a long way since their week 1 woes. What you showed me last week matters much more than week one.
*  Personnel considerations. The Cowboys lost Dak and Dalton over the past few weeks. Jerry is picking guys off the street to fill their QB spot. Big Ben might be out with COVID.
*  It doesn't account for the strength of the defenses you played. The way to the think about this is imagine a t1 which has only played lousy defenses. This t1 puts up 40 points a game. Their offense isn't that good, they've just been playing high school defenses. Then they go to Pittsburgh and play the hard nosed Steelers, even if the model is saying they will put up less points than usual, they will probably put up **much** less because they haven't played a real defense. I think this is the most accessible aspect to address, just takes some careful thought.
*  Doesn't work for no prior data. Guess I'm sticking to my gut for week 1 picks next year. ðŸ˜©
*  There's no evidence this is how reality actually is. See [Disclaimer](#disclaimer).
