### Introduction
This is a record of my quest to better understand how I can financially plan for my future. 
The world of finance is incredibly complicated. It's difficult to get a straight answer from someone
about what to do with your money. I share what I've learned and give actionable advice to others in similar
financial situations. Hope you learn something!

### TSP Allocations

As of 11/25/2020:

<!-- Make table -->

* `L 2065 - 0.35% G | 0.65% F | 48.77% C | 15.58% S | 34.65% I`
* `L 2055 - 0.49% G | 0.51% F | 48.77% C | 15.58% S | 34.65% I`
* `L 2050 - 10.14% G | 8.11% F | 40.36% C | 12.78% S | 28.61% I`

That seems kind of wacky that a five year retirement target date difference 
result's in a ~17% difference in stock allocation. Seems like the L 2055 is 
pretty much what I want at 26.
